# Abstract
- Financial fraud is an emerging threat with many consequences in the financial industry, corporate companies and government organizations.
- There are many criminal activities in the financial sector and credit card fraud is the most prevalent worldwide.

# Problem Statement
- It is estimated that 10,000 transactions take place via credit cards, every second worldwide.
- Every year, billions of dollars are lost because of credit card fraud. These cases occur under different circumstances such as;
    Transactions at points of Sale (POS)
    Online Transactions
    Transactions with lost or stolen credit cards
- Surveys have shown that the increase in the dependence of credit cards to perform financial transactions is accompanied by an increase in cases of fraud.

# Research Questions
- This project seeks to answer the following questions;
- 1. How can a fraud detection system be built using AI that can deal with imbalanced data effectively?
- 2. How can we clean the data before using it for training the machine to ensure high detection accuracy?
- 3. How can the system detect fraud by adopting to the behaviour of the user?

# Methodology
- The system uses Logistic Regression and KNN Clustering to answer the research questions.
- To ensure high accuracy detection, the mean-based method was used to deal with missing values.

# Evaluating and Building the model
- Four different classifiers will be used, these are;
- a) K-Nearest Neighbors
- b) Decision Tree
- c) Logistic Regression
- d) Random forest

# Building the Classifier
- Logistic regression was employed as opposed to linear regression. This is because logistic regression is more advanced as compared to the latter.

# Conclusion
- The increase in number of fraud cases in financial institutions has led to this project being a vital research field.
- A logistic regression-based classifier is proposed for this matter.
- The data is first cleaned, a classifier is then trained and finally the proposed classifier is trained.
- The logistic regression-based classifier generates the best results in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and error rate.

# Limitations
- The performance of the proposed classifier suffers in terms of response time. In addition, it doesnâ€™t apply to data in real time. The project was mainly for learning purposes.

# Libraries and Modules used
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Scikit-learn
- Itertools
