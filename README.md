# Abstract
- Financial fraud is an emerging threat with many consequences in the financial industry, corporate companies and government organizations.
- There are many criminal activities in the financial sector and credit card fraud is the most prevalent worldwide.

# Problem Statement
- It is estimated that 10,000 transactions take place via credit cards, every second worldwide.
- Every year, billions of dollars are lost because of credit card fraud. These cases occur under different circumstances such as;
    Transactions at points of Sale (POS)
    Online Transactions
    Transactions with lost or stolen credit cards
- Surveys have shown that the increase in the dependence of credit cards to perform financial transactions is accompanied by an increase in cases of fraud.

# Research Questions
- This project seeks to answer the following questions;
- 1. How can a fraud detection system be built using AI that can deal with imbalanced data effectively?
- 2. How can we clean the data before using it for training the machine to ensure high detection accuracy?
- 3. How can the system detect fraud by adopting to the behaviour of the user?

# Methodology
- The system uses Logistic Regression and KNN Clustering to answer the research questions.
- To ensure high accuracy detection, the mean-based method was used to deal with missing values.
Four different classifiers will be used, these are;
K-Nearest Neighbors
Decision Tree
Logistic Regression
Random forest
